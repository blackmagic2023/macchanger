# MAC Address Changer and Power Saving Disabler

This batch script is designed to change the MAC address and disable power saving mode for network adapters on a Windows system. It can be useful for various purposes, such as network troubleshooting, privacy protection, or circumventing network restrictions. However, please use it responsibly and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.

## How it Works

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Generating Random MAC Address**: It generates a semi-random MAC address for each network adapter detected on the system. The MAC address is composed of hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F).

2. **Disabling Power Saving Mode**: It disables power saving mode for each network adapter. This can help prevent the network adapter from entering sleep mode, which may disrupt network connectivity.

3. **Resetting NIC Adapters**: It resets the network interface controllers (NICs) to apply the new MAC address and disable power saving mode.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**: Download the `mac_address_changer.bat` file from this repository.

2. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click on the `mac_address_changer.bat` file and select "Run as administrator" to ensure proper permissions for modifying system settings.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The script will prompt you to confirm changes and may require user input during execution.

4. **Restart Network Services**: After the script completes, it's recommended to restart network services to ensure that the changes take effect.

## Notes

- **Windows Compatibility**: This script is designed to run on Windows systems. It may not work as intended on other operating systems.
  
- **Driver Support**: Windows driver support for changing MAC addresses and disabling power saving mode may vary. Some network adapters may not fully support these features, leading to inconsistent behavior.

- **Use Responsibly**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify system settings and use the script responsibly. Unauthorized modification of network settings may violate local laws or network policies.
